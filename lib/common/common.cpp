 * It correctly handles negative values of `x` by adding `m` when the remainder

 * @brief Calculates the minimal angular difference between two angles in degrees.
 * 
 * This function computes the smallest difference between two angles, `a` and `b`,
 * measured in degrees. The result is always in the range [0, 180], representing
 * the shortest rotation between the two angles, accounting for circular wrap-around.
 * 
 * For example, the difference between 350째 and 10째 is 20째, not 340째.
 * 
 * @param a The first angle in degrees.
 * @param b The second angle in degrees.
 * @return The minimal difference between the two angles, in degrees.
