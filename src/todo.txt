POSSIBLE MISTAKE IN DEFENDER CODE --> CONSULT APARAJ
 --> Robot may not go backward when it does not see the line, 
     I assume this is a simple turnary?

to do (outside of testing) -->
 - N/a

to do (relearning and refreshers) -->
 - ensure the new orbit is nailed into brain and is able to be explained
 - ensure that the defender vector method is also nailed into brain
 - trial interview with nathan to ensure that we know our stuff
 - possibly some rule quizzing with nathan/aparaj as well just to ensure that we also know the rules correctly.

to do (testing) --> 
 - ensure all sensors work BEFORE RUNNING --> communicate any damage to team
 - ensure all calculations work well before moving on.
    - new orbit (test this)
    - ensure defender calcs still work appropriately
    - 
 - ensure that all components and aspects of the robot are functional on their own before testing everything all together.
    e.g. make sure the attacking logic works, then the defending logic, then all else.
 - tune centering values | if not done in time then remove it from the code and logic, simply just make it stay still instead.
